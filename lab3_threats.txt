1.	Communication remains a big risk, especially as projects become more complex. To combat this, we will have to ensure that
each member keeps the team up to date on any code or document changes and regularly integrates with everyone else.

2.	Available time is also a risk. As finals approach and other projects become due, team members may not have as much free time.
Thus, good time management will be paramount to success.

3.	Knowledge and ability to use good software engineering principles is becoming increasingly important as our app becomes
more complex. Because of this, the threat of having our code and documents become unmanageable is possible.

4.	Workload balance is a recurring risk for us. It's easy to inadvertently assign too many or too few tasks to one individual,
which can result in inconsitent or lower quality work.

5.	External threats are becoming a bigger risk as our app becomes bigger and connects to other apps. Our threats list that we
submitted with this lab outlines many of the possibilities.
