Note: There appears to be an issue on some of the lab machines with the Geocoder. The method getAddressObjFromAddress() in NavigationFragment.java works on some lab computers, and fails on some lab computers. This is assumed
to be due to differences in the emulators and Android SDK versions; we were not able to determine the specific root cause.
