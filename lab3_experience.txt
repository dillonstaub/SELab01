Working on the data flow diagrams in Lab 3 gave us insight into how our app interacted with expernal entities,
data flows and stores, and where potential vulnerabilities were. None of us had made DFDs before, so working
through these was a valuable experience. In addition, identifying the key processes of our apps gave us a more
complete knowledge of how our entire system behaved and potential room for improvement.
